You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline.</p>\n<h5 class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Casting Elemental Spells</span></h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. See the <span style=\"color: rgba(71, 209, 140, 1)\"><a style=\"color: rgba(71, 209, 140, 1)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spellcasting</a></span> section&nbsp;for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don’t need to provide material components for it.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">burning hands</span> does. The spell’s level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">burning hands</span>, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline’s base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table.</p>\n<h5 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Spells and Ki Points</h5>\n<table id=\"table010\" class=\"Table TableOverride-3\"><colgroup></colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-3\">\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\"><strong>Monk Levels</strong></p>\n</th>\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\"><strong>Maximum Ki Points for a Spell</strong></p>\n</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">5th–8th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">3</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">9th–12th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">13th–16th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">5</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">17th–20th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">6</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"source":"Way of the Four Elements","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"featType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"time":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"damageType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true}},"sort":3100000},{"_id":"eoMk2iQCIMzLHyXb","flags":{},"name":"Elemental Disciplines","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">The elemental disciplines are presented in alphabetical order.

You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\n</ul>","chat":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before.
